I hope this helps anyone interested.

As at 2020-02-23 I have not made & tested this design but it is barely changed from the manufacrurers data sheets or other designs.
If you make & test it then please advise.

I'm new to KiCAD so I don't know how to do some things.  Such as how to have an 8-pin set of holes without a 3D chip sitting in it.
Or how to do an 8-pin header in the shape & pin count order of a chip.

Anyway, I've done what I can & it's now ready for many eye-balls.

Phill
