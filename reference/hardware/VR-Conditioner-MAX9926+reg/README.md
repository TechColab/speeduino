I hope this helps anyone interested.
Anyway, I've done what I can & it's now ready for many eye-balls.

I have not made & tested this design but it is barely changed from the manufacrurers data sheets or other designs.
If you make & test it then please advise.

I'm new to KiCAD so I don't know how to do some things.  Such as how to have an 8-pin set of holes without a 3D chip sitting in it.
Or how to do an 8-pin header in the shape & pin count order of a chip.

Changed version number to 3.5 so that it reflects relative cronology from previous design.
Renamed this from Notes.txt to README.md & corrected the date above.
Added Comments to schematic, inc. single-sided design allowing 'Letter' postage!
Updated BOM in schematic to reflect readily available parts found on OctoPart.

Confused with GitHub. Hopefully copied the changes made by noisymime back to my fork.
